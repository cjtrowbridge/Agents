Generating Python code to scrape `example.com` daily and store the results in an SQLite database involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide along with the corresponding Python code.
### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
You'll need some libraries for web scraping, handling HTTP requests, and interacting with SQLite databases. You can install these using pip:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 sqlite3
```
Note: `sqlite3` is included in Python's standard library, so you don't necessarily need to install it separately.
### Step 2: Create the Script
Here’s a sample script that scrapes data from `example.com`, stores it in an SQLite database, and runs daily using a cron job (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import sqlite3
from datetime import date
# Function to scrape the website
def scrape\_website():
url = "http://example.com"
try:
response = requests.get(url)
if response.status\_code == 200:
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
# Extract data you need from the page
title = soup.title.string.strip()
content = soup.find('p').text.strip() # Example: getting text from first paragraph
return {
"date": date.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
"title": title,
"content": content
}
else:
print(f"Failed to retrieve data. Status code: {response.status\_code}")
return None
except Exception as e:
print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
return None
# Function to store scraped data in SQLite database
def save\_to\_database(data):
conn = sqlite3.connect('scraped\_data.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
# Create table if it doesn't exist
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS scraped\_data (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
date TEXT,
title TEXT,
content TEXT
)
''')
# Insert data into the table
cursor.execute('INSERT INTO scraped\_data (date, title, content) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
(data['date'], data['title'], data['content']))
conn.commit()
conn.close()
# Main function to run scraping and saving process
def main():
print("Starting web scraping...")
data = scrape\_website()
if data:
save\_to\_database(data)
print(f"Data successfully saved for {data['date']}")
else:
print("No data was scraped today.")
if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_":
main()
```
### Step 3: Schedule the Script to Run Daily
#### On Linux/macOS (using cron):
1. Open your crontab file by running `crontab -e`.
2. Add a new line at the end of the file:
```bash
0 8 \* \* \* /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py >> /var/log/scraping.log 2>&1
```
This will run your script every day at 8 AM.
#### On Windows (using Task Scheduler):
1. Open Task Scheduler.
2. Create a new task and set it to trigger daily at the desired time.
3. Set the action to start a program, pointing to `python.exe` with the path to your script as an argument.
### Step 4: Verify
After setting up the cron job or scheduled task, verify that the script runs correctly by checking the log file (if you set one) and ensuring data is being inserted into the SQLite database.
This setup provides a basic framework for daily web scraping and storing results in an SQLite database. You can expand upon this by adding error handling, logging, and more sophisticated data extraction as needed.

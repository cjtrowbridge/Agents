# Agents
Me learning how to build a self-hosted agentic pipeline using ollama, jupyter, and autogen.

basic-diy.ipynb is me starting completely from scratch and figuring out how to get autogen to work and actually have a bunch of agents collaborate to do something, completely from scratch without reading the documentation first.
